gazel - a BUILD file generator for go and bazel
========

Requirements:
* Your project must be somewhat compatible with go tool because
  gazel uses go tool to parse your import tree.
* You must have a GOPATH and GOROOT setup and your project must
  be in the correct location in your GOPATH.
* Your ./vendor directory may not contain BUILD files.

Usage:

1. Get gazel by running go get github.com/mikedanese/gazel/gazel.

2. Create a .gazelcfg.json in the root of the repository. For the
   gazel repository, the .gazelcfg.json would look like:

   {
     "GoPrefix": "github.com/mikedanese/gazel",
     "SrcDirs": [
       "./gazel"
     ],
     "SkippedPaths": [
       ".*foobar(baz)?.*$"
     ]
   }

3. Run gazel:

  $ gazel -root=$GOPATH/src/github.com/mikedanese/gazel

Defaults:

* SrcDirs in .gazelcfg.json defaults to ["./"]
* -root option defaults to the current working directory

Automanagement:

gazel reconciles rules that have the "automanaged" tag. If
you no longer want gazel to manage a rule, you can remove the
automanaged tag and gazel will no longer mangae that rule.

gazel only manages srcs, deps, and library attributes of a
rule after initial creation so you can add and managed other
attributes like data and copts and gazel will respect your
changes.
